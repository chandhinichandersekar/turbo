# Turbo

TURBO is a real time two-player car racing game that allows game lovers to join a game and race against other players. The game can be found through the following URL, ‘turbo@chandhinichandersekar.com’. Once on the website, the player can join a new game by entering a game name that the player likes to join. The player can also join any of the currently running games listed on the home page. A player can race against another player or can just be an observer watching other players play. A player who joins a new game waits until there is a second player who joins the game. Once, both the players are part of the game they can now race against each other. Any other player, who joins the same game, would be allowed to view the game as an observer. During the race, there are several obstacles on the road, which the players will encounter. Hitting any obstacle would move the player’s car a few steps back. The player should now play from that (moved back) position. The game ends if a player’s car crashes against the other player’s car. The player who crashed looses and the other player becomes the winner. A player is also a winner if the player’s car crosses the finish line first. Once a game is over, players can join another game by clicking on the ‘join new game’ link. This game was developed using React, React-Konva, Elixir and Pheonix channel.
